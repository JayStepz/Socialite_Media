## Summary
<p>Attempted to make a social media back-end allowing users to post/edit/delete thoughts, post/edit/delete reactions to thoughts, and to add/delete other users as friends.<br>As of 6/1/2023, project is incomplete. Part-time coding bootcamp is part-time in attendance hours only.</p>

## Credit
<p>Just wanted to give my friend, Brandon, a shout out yet again for helping me with some of this project.<br>Also, thanks to the two random StackOverflow posts I found whose URLs are buried too deep within my browser history for me to find.</p>
